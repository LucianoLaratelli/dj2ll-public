//of a null (i.e., unallocated) object.
//This is called a null-dereference error because we
//are attempting to dereference, or get the value of, 
//a variable whose object-value is null (i.e., 0).

//During execution, this program produces no output.
//Instead it halts after a null-dereference check fails.
